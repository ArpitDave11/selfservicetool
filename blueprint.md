You must generate a GitLab EPIC Markdown that EXACTLY matches my “Technical Design Blueprint” structure.

HARD RULES (MUST FOLLOW)
- Use the exact heading list below, in this exact order, with identical titles:
  1. Objective
  2. Background & Context
  3. Scope (3.1 In Scope, 3.2 Out of Scope)
  4. Assumptions
  5. High-Level Architecture Overview (diagram must appear immediately after this section’s text)
  6. Architecture Diagrams (references only; do not paste diagrams here)
  7. Team & Roles
  8. Environments & CI/CD Strategy
  9. Data Security & Access Controls
  10. Data Stores, Services & Interfaces
  11. Key Features & User Stories
  12. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
  13. Dependencies & Risks (13.1 Dependencies, 13.2 Risks)
  14. Deliverables
  15. Next Steps
  16. Definition of Done (DoD)
  17. Approvals & Sign-Offs
- Do NOT add new sections or change names.
- Do NOT invent facts; if missing, write “TBD”.
- Insert ONE multi-level C4-style Mermaid or PlantUML diagram directly under Section 5 (not in Section 6).
- Return ONLY the final Markdown EPIC. No extra commentary.
